             <div>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is spread mainly from person-to-person, usually via close contact
                  (within six feet). That could be via physical contact, like handshaking (if someone's hands are contaminated with the virus) or touching
                  contaminated surfaces."A sneezing or coughing person will cover their mouth, get it all over their hand, and then touch something that you
                  then touch," Robert Murphy, MD, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern University, tells Health. The virus can then gain entry into
                  your body when you touch your own face, he adds.Simply being near an infected person who coughs, sneezes, or talks can expose you to their
                  infected respiratory droplets, the CDC says. It those virus-containing particles land in your eyes, nose, or mouth, or if it they get on
                  your hands and your rub any of those places on your face, you could possibly acquire the infection. And some people may be capable of spreading
                  it to others even though they don't have any symptoms, the CDC points out.
