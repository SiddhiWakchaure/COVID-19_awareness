             <div>What is self isolation?</br></br></div>  

                   Due to the high risk of Covid-19 that is currently spreading all around the world we need to take self isolation very seriously.
                   Self isolation is the procedure of separating yourself from others, in this case the reason we have to self isolate is to protect
                   our personal health and the people in our communities health. This will help slow down the spread of Covid-19 (Coronavirus) to reduce
                   any more confirmed cases or deaths.</br></br></br>  


            <div>When should you self isolate?</br></br></div>  

                   At the moment, the UK are on a lockdown; meaning a lot of people are out of work and have to work from home and only allowed out to
                   get essentials (shopping or medication). It is highly important if you have the virus or symptoms (even if their mild) to self isolate
                   for seven days. You shouldn’t come into contact with anyone, especially the high risk sector. If after seven days you still have a high
                   temperature, keep self isolating until you temperature returns to normal.The symptoms consist of a persistent new cough and/or high
                   temperature, avoid calling 111 and just continue to self isolate, if the symptoms have got worst or haven’t disappeared after the 14 days,
                   proceed calling 111 to ask for advice.If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their
                   symptoms started. This is because it can take 14 days for symptoms to appear.</br></br></br>
